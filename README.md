# SPI-core
This project involves the design and verification of a Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) Master IP Core, integrated with an Advanced Peripheral Bus (APB) interface for register-level control. The core enables a processor or digital system to communicate with external SPI-compatible devices such as sensors, memories, and displays.
